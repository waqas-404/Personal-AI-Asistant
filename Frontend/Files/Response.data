ORA : Ramadan Mubarak, sir. May this blessed month bring you peace, prosperity, and spiritual growth. Fasting and praying five times a day can be challenging, but it's a great way to strengthen your faith and connect with Allah. Remember to stay hydrated, take care of your physical health, and make the most of this opportunity to seek forgiveness, guidance, and spiritual renewal. How's your experience been so far, sir?
